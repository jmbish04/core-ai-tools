/**
 * check-d1-not-inherited.mjs — refuse to deploy while wrangler.jsonc is bound to a
 * D1 database that is not this project's own.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Measured 2026-11-02: `database_id` d555f8ce-77c9-4c82-be80-de95b8d9c003 is the
 * account's spend-governor database — core-guardian's production D1, holding
 * billable_usage, alert_rules, cf_billing_*, workers_ai_daily_neurons,
 * ai_routing_decisions, spend_rollup and about 115 more tables (123 tables,
 * 400.2 MB). Cloudflare still lists it under the name it was created with,
 * core-template-cfw-assets-astro-shadcn, because a template created it and
 * core-guardian adopted it. wrangler's `database_name` is cosmetic; the uuid is
 * what binds. That is why five Workers pointed at this one database while each
 * `wrangler.jsonc` claimed a different `database_name`, and why every app
 * scaffolded from that template ran its own Drizzle migrations against the
 * Worker that holds the account's shut-down switches. A server-side search
 * found the uuid on 13 default branches.
 *
 * THE RULES — two, because two different mistakes put a foreign uuid here.
 *
 * 1. NEVER a known-foreign database, whatever this project is called. A copy that
 *    reverts wrangler.jsonc, or pastes an old id back, is caught by identity, not
 *    by inference. This is the rule that would have caught the live bug.
 *
 * 2. A template must carry a placeholder, not a uuid. While package.json's `name`
 *    is still a `core-template*` name, any uuid-shaped `database_id` is refused:
 *    a copy pasting a real id while still wearing the template's identity is
 *    almost certainly pasting the id it inherited. Renaming the package is the
 *    first thing anyone does to a copy, so it is the signal that separates "still
 *    the template" from "a real app".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-d1-not-inherited.mjs               # gate a deploy or migration
 *   node scripts/check-d1-not-inherited.mjs --self-check  # prove the rules can fail
 *
 * Wire it into package.json so a deploy cannot skip it — `pull-agents` warns when
 * no script invokes it:
 *   "check:d1":       "node scripts/check-d1-not-inherited.mjs",
 *   "migrate:remote": "node scripts/check-d1-not-inherited.mjs && …",
 *   "deploy":         "node scripts/check-d1-not-inherited.mjs && …",
 *
 * ponytail: FOREIGN is a short denylist rather than an ownership lookup because
 * nothing offline can prove which Worker owns a uuid. Add an entry when a shared
 * database is found; an API call at deploy time would need a token this check
 * must not require.
